Collection of simple BASH scripts to make video editing quicker.

How to use:
    - put the three scripts into the folder containing the videos
    - ./01_make_metadata.sh
    - go in the (new) "metadata" folder and edit aaa.csv by writing
        the desired cut for each video
    - ./02_cut_and_glue.sh
    - ./03_clean.sh

The resulting video has the name "output.mp4".
All your original files are always untouched and preserved.
